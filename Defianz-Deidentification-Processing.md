# Background


# Key Process
There are three key processes that this platform is intended to support and enable. Every key process and aspect of this system ties back to the iDaaS-KIC (Auditing) system. 

The key for the platform are: 
- Application: Source application where data is provided 
- Organization: Source Organization where data is provided
- Industry Std: Industry Std to leverage, this covers all scenarios including flat files
- Data Type / Message Type: This can be anything from a specific data type or message type (if industry stds are involved)
- PersonIdentity Attributes: Based on the implementation the specific data attributes combined to make a person identity. It can be changed at anytime; however, so will the generated metadata within the platform just making any existing personidentity invalid
- PersonIdentity: The generated internal value produced within the Defianz platform based on the personidentity attributes presented to the platform for value creation.
- Data Mappings: This is the mapping from source fields to target fields and needs to include the synthetic data attributes involved when the data is mapped.

## Creation of a Unique Idenifier for Input Data
This process deals with how the platform identifies data records presented to it. 

The Defianz platform first tier component before anything can be done within it is unique identification of input data


## Relationship of Data for Processing

## Data Association to De-Identified Data
